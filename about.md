I am a software dev freelancer. Before I quit my job and started freelancing, I worked for 25+ years in the software industry, with 18 years at Cisco writing software for IOS and IOS-XE routers and switches. In my time I have written code for networking features (PBR, VXLAN, that sort of thing), FPGA drivers, chassis management code, ISSU and lots more than I can remember. As part of my job at Cisco I have experience in troubleshooting customer networks, but I have no certs (didn't need them for my job).

Most of my work experience was in C/C++, but Python is now my language of choice for most of my [GitHub projects](https://github.com/vnetman)

I am a [regular contributor](https://www.reddit.com/user/vnetman) on reddit, mostly on r/networking. For a while I also used to contribute to the Network Engineering StackExchange site as user [mere3ortal](https://networkengineering.stackexchange.com/users/22665/mere3ortal).

As a freelancer my most significant project involved refactoring the 'hosts3d' program to improve the program's performance. My fork of the code is [on github](https://github.com/vnetman/hosts3d). On my client's request, I documented my refactoring changes [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/h9uz6xhd6c5n8ia/MyHT.pdf?dl=0).

I am located in Bangalore (India), UTC+0530.

My email provider is zoho.com, and my mail id is the name of this blog ("vn...an").
